# Scapy Packet Crafting & Analysis – Lab Project

## Overview
This project demonstrates the use of **Scapy (Python)** to craft and send
basic network packets for learning and defensive security analysis.

The goal of this project is **not exploitation**, but to understand:
- How packets are structured
- How firewalls interpret traffic
- How rule-based firewalls (pfSense) react to crafted packets

This project complements my **pfSense firewall lab** by validating
allowed and blocked traffic at the packet level.
